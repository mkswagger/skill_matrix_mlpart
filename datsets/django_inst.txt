Prepare your Django project
a. Install Django if you haven't already. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install django

b. Create a new Django project by running the following command:

django-admin startproject projectname

c. Create a new Django app by running the following command:

python manage.py startapp appname

Import your resume parser model
a. Import the necessary libraries and functions for your resume parser model at the top of your views.py file.

b. Load your resume parser model using the appropriate functions from the libraries you imported.

Define your API endpoint
a. Define your API endpoint by creating a function in your views.py file that will handle the incoming requests.

b. Use the @csrf_exempt decorator to allow incoming requests to bypass Django's built-in CSRF protection.

c. Define the HTTP method that your API endpoint will accept (i.e., POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).

d. Parse the incoming request data, if necessary, and pass it to your resume parser model.

e. Return the results of your resume parser model as a JSON response.

Test your API
a. Start your Django development server by running the following command:

python manage.py runserver

b. Test your API by sending a sample request to the endpoint you defined in Step 3 using a tool such as Postman or cURL.

Deploy your API
a. Deploy your Django project to a production server.

b. Configure your production server to serve your Django project over HTTPS.

c. Secure your production server by configuring a firewall and implementing other security measures as needed.

d. Monitor your API for errors and performance issues, and make necessary adjustments as needed.

That's it! By following these steps, you should now have your resume parser model deployed as an API using Django.
